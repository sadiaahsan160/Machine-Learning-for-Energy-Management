# Predictive Analysis of Energy Consumption Patterns using Machine Learning

**Project overview:** This project developes a machine learning-based model that can accurately predict household energy consumption across various time intervals, including hourly, daily, and weekly periods. By leveraging historical energy consumption data and employing a state-of-the-art machine learning model, the aim is to build a predictive model that not only captures the underlying patterns in energy consumption but also provides insights for effective energy management strategies
